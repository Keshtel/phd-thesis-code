for converting MAsk h5 file to points use the script here
for annotation first set the total number of neurons to the upper limit of neurons you want to annotate. Then assigne a letter-key to each neuron/number and go through the ground truth frames and press that key when the curser is at the location of the neuron. Font forget to save

To make the code work and not give error with initialization of NN I changed something in main_controller.py file line 93:
self.NN_pointdat = np.full((self.frame_num,self.n_neurons,3),np.nan)

For running on cluster use the .csh file:
 #!/bin/tcsh
